<p style="color: #ffffff">SimpleCoil is provided free with the hope that it will be useful. SimpleCoil comes with no warranty and may damage your hardware.</p>
<p style="color: #ffffff">SimpleCoil is intended to be used with RECOIL laser tag toys and cannot be used without the appropriate accessories. This app does not need a Wi-Fi connection or hub to be used. Some of the advanced features that you may be used to with the first-party app are not available here. However, this simple app will not experience any connection issues and should run well on older, slower devices.</p>
<p style="color: #ffffff">Tap the power button to toggle recoil. Tap the thumb/rear/talk button to switch firing modes.</p>
<p style="color: #ffffff">Players that are on the same team cannot shoot each other - no friendly fire.</p>
<p style="color: #ffffff">The network support does not require the use of the official hub, but will work with the official hub. Instead of using a server, clients will attempt to find and connect to each other directly over the same Wi-Fi network.</p>
